# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning. The dataset comes from Kaggleâ€™s Titanic Challenge, where we apply classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
